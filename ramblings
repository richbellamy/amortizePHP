#############  Ideas for future rewrites  ##################

### Easy many-one or one-many linking ###
Allow the placement of class instances directly in table definitions as a sort of one-way DB link like this:
class MapPoint extends PrimaryDatabaseMagicObject {
    protected $table_defs = array(
    "mappoints" => array(
      'lat'     => "double",
      'lon'     => "double",
      'address' => "tinytext"
    )
  );
}
class Place extends DatabaseMagicObject {
  protected $table_defs = array(
    "places" => array(
      'name'        => "tinytext",
      'description' => "text",
      'point'       => "dbm_MapPoint"
    )
  );
}
Place->point will return a MapPoint
The point column in the places table will match the definition of the primary key in the mappoints table
Loading the Place will cause Place->point to be initialized as a new Point


### Rewrite ###
Rewrite the whole thing as a class stack instead of a monolithic class with a mess of support functions
